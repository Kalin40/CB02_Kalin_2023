                    <p id="abouTitle1">User experience (UX) refers to how people interact with a product or service.
                        It's all about
                        creating experiences that are intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable for users. UX designers work
                        to understand user needs and behaviors, and then use that knowledge to create products and
                        services that meet those needs.</p>
                    <p>One of the key methodologies used in UX design is user-centered design (UCD). UCD is an iterative
                        process that involves understanding user needs, prototyping solutions, and testing those
                        solutions with users to ensure they meet their needs. The goal of UCD is to create products and
                        services that are easy to use, useful, and satisfying for users.</p>

                    <h2>Research</h2>
                    <p>1. What method did you use and why? I suggested two possible research methods for gathering
                        information on BeReal's target group: survey and analytics. The choice of method would depend on
                        the specific research questions and objectives, as well as the available resources and timeline.
                        A survey would be a more direct and personalized way of gathering feedback from the target
                        group, while analytics would provide a more quantitative and objective overview of the user
                        behavior.
                        2. Why was this the best one at the time? Since we have many colleagues at the oil we could
                        easily asked them. Both survey and analytics have their own advantages and disadvantages, and
                        the choice would depend on the specific needs of the research.
                        3. What was the result from that research? As the research was actual survey we had data about
                        age, gender, some problems that users donâ€™t like and some solutions etc.
                        4. Did you got research questions answered, or did you get more questions? Based on the research
                        methods suggested, it is possible that some research questions would be answered, while others
                        may arise. For example, a survey may provide insights into the target group's needs and
                        preferences but may also reveal new questions or concerns that were not previously considered.
                        5. What design thinking phase are you in? Based on the research questions provided, the design
                        thinking phase would be in the "understand" phase, where the focus is on gathering insights and
                        empathy for the target users. The research methods suggested would be part of the "discover"
                        stage, where the focus is on understanding the target users' needs, behaviors, and preferences.

                    <h2>Principles of design</h2>
                    <p>The method I used, was an online research based on the pdf and some other online resources. I
                        have used this method because it provides a convenient and accessible way to gather information
                        about the principles of UX design psychology.
                        The online research was likely the best method available at the time, as it allowed me to gather
                        a large amount of information in a relatively short period of time. It also provided me with
                        access to a range of sources, such as articles, case studies, and videos, which could help you
                        to understand the principles of UX design psychology and how they are applied in practice.
                        The result of my research is to understand the principles of UX design psychology and how they
                        can be applied to improve user experience. I have found real-life examples that illustrate how
                        these principles work in practice, which can help me to see how they can be applied in my own
                        work.
                        In terms of research questions, the research has answered some questions about the principles of
                        UX design psychology, but it also has raised new questions that I wanted to explore further. For
                        example, I have found that a certain principle is particularly effective in improving user
                        experience.
                        Finally, in terms of design thinking phases, I was in the research phase. This is the phase
                        where I gather information about the problem Iâ€™m trying to solve and the users Iâ€™m designing
                        for. By conducting online research and gathering real-life examples, Iâ€™m building a deeper
                        understanding of the principles of UX design psychology and how they can be applied to improve
                        user experience.

                    <h2>Interview preparation</h2>
                    <p>We used an interview method to gather information about our client's needs and preferences for
                        her website. An interview is a research method that involves asking open-ended questions to
                        elicit detailed responses from participants. This method was likely appropriate in this case
                        because it allowed us to gather detailed information about her needs and preferences, as well as
                        her opinions on various design elements.
                        The result of our research is a clearer understanding of our client's needs and preferences for
                        her website. We have gathered information about the products, the target audience, and the
                        desired design principles for the website. This information can be used to develop a design
                        concept that meets her needs and preferences.
                        We have answered some of our research questions, such as the target audience and the desired
                        design principles etc. However, we have also generated more questions, such as how to
                        incorporate the "story" aspect of the website and how to present the products in a visually
                        appealing way.
                        During the Empathize phase, we gathered information about our client's needs and preferences
                        through the interview method. During the Define phase, we used this information to clarify the
                        design challenge and identify design criteria, such as the desired design principles and target
                        audience.

                    <p>Based on the user stories I created for the thermostat software I primarily used user research
                        methods such as internet research and primary research survey. These methods allowed me to
                        gather insights and understand user needs related to temperature regulation in homes with a

                        guide the design and development of the thermostat software.
                        I had some extra questions or new areas of exploration. Therefore, it's important to remain open
                        to
                        new insights and feedback from users as you move through the design thinking process.

                    <h2>Persona </h2>
                    <p>We used a survey method to gather data and create a persona. Surveys are a popular research
                        method that allow us to collect quantitative data from a large group of people quickly and
                        efficiently. Surveys are useful because they allow you to collect data from a diverse group of
                        people, which can help us identify patterns and trends in behavior and attitudes.
                        The survey method was likely the best one for our research because it allowed us to collect data
                        from a large sample of students quickly and efficiently. Additionally, since our research
                        focused on online shopping and Greek toys, it is likely that the survey method was the most
                        appropriate because it allowed us to gather data from different populations.
                        The result of our research was likely the creation of a persona that represented the responses
                        of the survey participants. This persona likely provided us with valuable insights into the
                        behavior, attitudes, and preferences of our target audience. Additionally, the persona has
                        helped us to identify areas where we could improve our online website and better meet the needs
                        of our target audience.
                        Our research answered some of our research questions, such as how much time people are willing
                        to wait for a product and what their expectations are. However, the research raised more
                        questions that we will need to address in future research. However, thatâ€™s why we have made an
                        interviews.
                        During this phase, we gather insights and information about our target audience to develop a
                        deeper understanding of their needs, motivations, and goals. The creation of a persona based on
                        survey data is a common technique used during the Empathize phase of design thinking.
