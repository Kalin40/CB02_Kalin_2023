                    <p>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the core technologies used in web development. HTML (Hypertext
                        Markup Language) is used for structuring web content, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for
                        styling web content, and JavaScript is used for adding interactivity and functionality to web
                        pages.</p>
                    <p>HTML provides the foundation for a web page, allowing developers to define the structure and
                        content of the page using tags and attributes. CSS is then used to style the HTML content,
                        providing visual design elements such as colors, fonts, and layouts. JavaScript is used to add
                        dynamic features to the page, such as animations, form validation, and interactive elements.</p>
                    <p>Overall, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the foundation of web development, and mastering these
                        technologies is key to building effective, functional, and visually appealing websites.</p>

                    <h2>What did we learned</h2>
                    <p>Short recap what we did at the weeks:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is the main subject where we build our selves. Here we have a lecture every week
                            about something new, so we build new knowledge every time. We started from html and css and
                            we
                            were not allowed to use js. First week we were making simple navigation bar. Second week
                            we had 3 examples of website and we had to do it the same looking the way we think is good.
                            Week 3 we had introduction about animation with some advanced examples where at the end
                            we had to come up with prototype of microwave and also make timer again with pure html and
                            css. Week 4 we had introduction for js and then the assignment was to work on the microwave
                            so it can look better and also take one of the examples from week 2 and customize the font
                            and
                            the
                            color with js. Week 5 we were goinf deeper with JS, such as: JS types, the differences
                            between var let and const, interesting peculiarities of logical operators and The way
                            arithmetic operators behave when their operands are not numbers </li>

                    <h2>JavaScript types:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>JavaScript has six primitive data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, and
                            symbol. Objects in JavaScript are not considered a primitive data type. Instead, they are
                            complex data types that can hold multiple values of different types. JavaScript uses type
                            coercion, which means that it will automatically convert data types if necessary. For
                            example, if you try to add a string and a number together, JavaScript will convert the
                            number to a string and concatenate them. Type checking in JavaScript can be done using the
                            typeof operator, which returns a string indicating the type of the operand.</li>

                    <h2>var let and const:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Var has function scope, while let and const have block scope. This means that variables
                            declared with var are accessible throughout the entire function, while variables declared
                            with let and const are only accessible within the block they are declared in (e.g. within a
                            loop, if statement, or curly braces). Var can be redeclared and reassigned, while let can be
                            reassigned but not redeclared, and const can neither be reassigned nor redeclared. </li>
                        <li>In general, it's best to use let and const over var in modern JavaScript code, as they
                            provide better scoping and are more in line with the principle of immutability (i.e. not
                            changing values once they are assigned). However, there may be cases where var is still
                            useful, particularly in legacy code or when writing scripts that need to be compatible with
                            older browsers.</li>

                    <h2>&& , || , and ! </h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The && operator returns the first falsy value it encounters, or the last truthy value. If
                            all values are truthy, it returns the last value. For example, 0 && "hello" && false will
                            return 0, while "hello" && true && 42 will return 42. </li>
                        <li>The || operator returns the first truthy value it encounters, or the last falsy value. If
                            all values are falsy, it returns the last value. For example, null || false || undefined
                            will return undefined, while "hello" || true || 42 will return "hello".</li>
                        <li>The ! operator is a unary operator that negates a boolean value. If the value is truthy, it
                            returns false, and if the value is falsy, it returns true.</li>

                        <li>The + operator: If one or both operands are strings, the + operator will perform string
                            concatenation instead of addition. For example, 5 + "5" will result in the string "55". If
                            one operand is a string and the other operand is not a string, the non-string operand will
                            be coerced into a string before the concatenation takes place.</li>
                        <li>The -, *, /, and % operators: If one or both operands are not numbers, JavaScript will
                            attempt to convert them to numbers before performing the operation. If the conversion is not
                            possible, the operation will return NaN (Not a Number). For example, "5" - 2 will result in
                            the number 3.</li>

                            necessarily in type. If the types are different, JavaScript will attempt to convert one or
                            both values to a common type before making the comparison. For example, 1 == "1" would
