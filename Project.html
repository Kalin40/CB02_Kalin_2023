                    <p id="abouTitle1">Working on a project for a client involves collaborating with a client to
                        identify their needs
                        and deliver a product or service that meets those needs. This can include developing a website,
                        creating a branding strategy, designing a product, or providing a range of other services.</p>
                    <p>The key to successful project delivery is effective communication and collaboration with the
                        client. This involves understanding the client's goals, gathering requirements, and delivering
                        regular updates and progress reports. It's important to work closely with the client to ensure
                        that their needs are met and that the project is delivered on time and within budget.</p>
                    <p>Overall, working on a project for a client requires strong communication, collaboration, and
                        adaptability skills. By working closely with the client and delivering high-quality results, you
                        can establish a strong reputation as a trusted partner and deliver successful projects that meet
                        your client's needs.</p>

                    <h2>Main question and Sub questions</h2>
                    <p>Provides clarity: Having a well-defined main question and sub-questions ensures that the team has
                        a clear understanding of what they are trying to achieve in the project.</p>
                    <p>
                        Division of labor: The main question and sub-questions allow the team to divide the work among
                        themselves, ensuring that everyone has a specific task to complete, and progress can be
                        monitored efficiently.</p>
                    <p>
                        Comprehensive research: The sub-questions can help the team to focus on specific areas of
                        research, ensuring that a comprehensive analysis is carried out. This ensures that the team does
                        not miss out on any essential details.</p>
                    <p>
                        Improved efficiency: By breaking down the main question into sub-questions, the team can work
                        more efficiently, as each member can focus on their particular task, leading to a more
                        productive and efficient project.</p>
                    <p>
                        Better outcomes: Working on a main question and sub-questions ensures that the team has a
                        structured approach to the project, leading to better outcomes. This also ensures that the final
                        product is of high quality and meets the project's objectives.</p>

                        of the project, as well as the specific needs and preferences of the client. By asking targeted

                        that meets the client's requirements and expectations. Additionally, asking questions can help
                        to establish clear communication and expectations between the client and the team, which can

                    <h2>User stories</h2>
                    <p>Based on the user stories I created for the project I primarily used user research methods such
                        as internet research and survey that we did with the group. These methods allowed me to gather
                        insights and understand user needs related to temperature regulation in homes with a thermostat
                        in the main floor/ room.
                        The user stories I created can be seen as a way to synthesize and make sense of the research
                        findings, which is a common practice in the design thinking process. By creating user stories,
                        Iâ€™m able to distill the research findings into specific user needs and requirements such as
                        behind the scenes of a toy and Ancient Greek toys in general.
                        The research lead me to more questions or new areas of exploration, however thatâ€™s normal.
