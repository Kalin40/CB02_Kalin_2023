                    <p>Introduction:

                        In this final report, Olivia and I present a detailed account of our collaborative
                        efforts. Our primary goal was to provide a comprehensive overview of the project, highlighting
                        various key aspects. We began by introducing the client. To ensure efficiency, we divided the
                        workload between us and actively sought
                        feedback to enhance our work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A critical aspect of our project was identifying the target audience, which we achieved through
                        research, interviews, and survey. This information helped us create user stories that shaped
                        our design process. By conducting surveys, we gathered valuable data that informed the creation
                        of persona.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project also involved designing a prototype, which we thoroughly tested with users. Their
                        feedback and insights proved invaluable in refining our product. Finally, we concluded the
                        report by summarizing our findings and drawing meaningful conclusions from the project as a
                        whole.

                        This report serves as a comprehensive documentation of our project journey, highlighting the
                        various steps we took to achieve our objectives.

                    <p>The card sorting activity was implemented to gain valuable user insights regarding website layout

                        the initial challenges we faced in this area, I took on the responsibility of improving

                        productive and efficient project.</p>

                    <p>Based on the user stories I created for the project I primarily used user research methods such
                        as internet research and survey that we did with the group. These methods allowed me to gather
                        insights and understand user needs related to temperature regulation in homes with a thermostat
                        in the main floor/ room.
                        The user stories I created can be seen as a way to synthesize and make sense of the research
                        findings, which is a common practice in the design thinking process. By creating user stories,
                        I’m able to distill the research findings into specific user needs and requirements such as
                        behind the scenes of a toy and Ancient Greek toys in general.
                        The research lead me to more questions or new areas of exploration, however that’s normal.
